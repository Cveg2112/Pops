Pops - a tiny, simple popup manager for Wordpress.

== Description ==

Early implementation of a simple wordpress pop-up. This pop-up uses two external libraries which need to be inlucded on your site.:
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-cookie/1.4.1/jquery.cookie.min.js
AND
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/magnific-popup.js/0.9.9/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js

At some point this won't be so dependant on external stuff.
Deal with it.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php echo get_pops(); ?>` in your templates
